# Stock_prediction_with_LSTM
This project revolves around the comprehensive analysis and prediction of Amazon Inc.'s stock prices. Leveraging historical data spanning from May 1997 to May 2024, the project encapsulates a multi-step process. Initially, the data is meticulously preprocessed, ensuring accuracy and integrity. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) techniques are then employed to unveil intricate relationships and trends within the dataset. Notably, correlation matrices and heatmaps aid in visualizing these patterns. The project's core lies in predictive modeling, where a sophisticated Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network is crafted using TensorFlow and Keras. This model is trained on the preprocessed data, optimizing its parameters to minimize prediction errors. Evaluation metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) gauge the model's performance. Moreover, the model's training history is visualized to ensure effective learning. Subsequently, the model's capabilities are put to the test by predicting Apple's stock prices for the subsequent ten days. The resulting predictions are then juxtaposed against actual historical prices, providing insights into potential future trends. Overall, this project serves as a robust framework for stock price analysis and prediction, offering valuable tools for financial data analysis and time series forecasting.
